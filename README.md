# HEALTH ACETS: "A Covid Exploration Tracking Synergy"

# INTRODUCTION

The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), an infectious disease. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) developed the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), a highly transmissible and pathogenic virus that caused a global pandemic and a considerable loss of human life. According to a genetic analysis, bats could be the primary reservoir. SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically related to bat viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Despite the fact that the source of genesis and transmission to humans is unknown, the rapid human-to-human transmission has been demonstrated. COVID-19 has not yet been treated with a clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine. However, only a few broad-spectrum antiviral medicines have been tested in clinical trials against COVID-19, with clinical recovery. The majority of those infected with the virus will have mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and will recover without the need for medical attention. Some, on the other hand, will become critically unwell and require medical assistance. Serious sickness is more likely to strike the elderly and those with underlying medical disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer. COVID-19 can make anyone sick and cause them to get very ill or die at any age.

Wuhan, China's emerging commercial hub, recently saw an outbreak of a novel coronavirus that killed over eighteen hundred people and infected over seventy thousand in the first fifty days of the pandemic. This virus was identified as belonging to the coronavirus family. The Chinese researchers termed the new virus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov). The virus was called SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV), and the disease was named COVID-19 by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV). SRAS-CoV (2003) infected 8098 people in 26 countries, with a 9% mortality rate; nevertheless, as of this writing, new corona virus (2019) has infected 120,000 people in 109 countries, with a 2.9 percent mortality rate. It shows that SARS-CoV-2 had a higher transmission rate than SRAS-CoV, which could be attributed to a genetic recombination event at the S protein in SARS-RBD CoV-2's region, which boosted transmission ability. In this review article, the transmission of human coronaviruses is briefly discussed. SARS and MERS are also discussed in terms of infectiousness and biochemical features, with a focus on COVID-19.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
# SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
This data analysis study will shed new light on the country's updates and analyzation of the Corona Virus's impacts. The following people will benefit from this research:

•	Community

This study informs the public about potential solutions and strategies for ensuring their safety and awareness throughout their lives.

•	Students 

Students will benefit immediately from this study since the findings may inspire them to look into data analytics as a means to help their community establish effective Covid tracking and response plans for the lifelong corona virus. They will also be told about their preparations or how to make themselves and their loved ones aware of the situation.

•	Parents 

This study may motivate parents to pursue programs that incorporate teaching to help students cope with Covid's negative effects.

•	Government 

This research will let them take immediate action, before the public becomes aware of the pandemic or the corona virus, by analyzing every single case of the pandemic or the corona virus. The planning process and ideas from established frameworks in the Philippines will help them figure out how to organize, create, and develop the community in a week while maintaining their healthy practices.

•	Future Researchers 

This paper discusses the tracking that encompasses and response frameworks to minimize the enlarging number of cases by the virus. Thus, the findings of this study may be utilized to inform future conversations and analysis of effective frameworks employed by governments throughout the world that the Philippine government could adopt for its own system.

# METHODS

The researcher will utilize quantitative data analysis, or drawing computational insights from raw data, as well as qualitative data analysis, such as thematic analysis, to accomplish these goals.

•  Data Requirement Gathering 

This procedure includes assessing the topic's importance and determining the type of data necessary to achieve the goals.
  
•  Data Collection

This procedure entails locating datasets that are relevant to the subject. We explore other sources of data using the needs we set as a guide. 

•  Data Analysis

This procedure entails gleaning meaningful information from the data. 

•  Data Interpretation

This procedure entails summarizing and translating the outcomes of data analysis into meaningful information.

•  Data Visualization

This method entails displaying data in a graphical way so that people may readily read and comprehend it.


# EXPECTED OUTPUT

This inquiry will provide an exploratory look into Covid instances from 2020 to 2021that resulted in the highest number of deaths in the country, as well as information on adjacent legislatures with the most affected families. The datasets or information from the Department of Health (DOH) will be utilized to develop a Covid tracking and a possible outcome, which could aid the Philippines in combating the disease. Filipinos' possibilities getting by and recuperating from Coronavirus will unquestionably improve assuming the methodology suggested by accomplice associations like the World Health Organization (WHO) are taken.
